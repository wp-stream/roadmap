# Stream Roadmap

The Stream Roadmap is a place for high-to-mid-level ideas around the future of [Stream][1]. Some of them simply won't be possible. Others will require some serious innovation to implement. Others still, just need a little tweaking to get right.

The purpose of the roadmap is to present a vision for Stream. As a community of contributors, we can't work toward something better unless there is a bar, and we won't reach our potential unless the bar is set high enough.

## How can I see the roadmap?

Go to [http://wp-stream.github.io/roadmap/][2].

## How do I contribute?

Do you see something you would like to add, change, tweak, or remove? There are three ways you could contribute.

1. Create a [New Issue][3]. Detail what you think should change, and why.
2. Fork this repo, make some changes to the roadmap.md file, and issue a Pull Request against the master branch. In your PR, details what you are changing, and why.
3. Browse the list of [issues and pull requests][4], and include your thoughts as comments on each of them.

All changes will be held for a period of 30 days with the tag "feedback-required". Once the 30 days have expired, if there is community concensus, the changes will be made.

## Can I get some help?

Yes! Email [support@wp-stream.com][5].
